# üéØ Complete Guide for Non-Developers

**Transform your business idea into an AI agent that earns money automatically**

This guide assumes you have **no coding experience** and walks you through everything step by step. By the end, you'll have a working AI agent earning from the ACP network.

## üìñ What You're Building

Think of this as creating a **digital employee** that:
- Works 24/7 automatically
- Processes requests from customers
- Gets paid for every successful job
- Scales without hiring more people

**Real Examples:**
- A data analysis agent that processes customer spreadsheets
- A content writing agent that creates product descriptions
- A translation agent that converts documents between languages
- A research agent that summarizes market reports

## üé™ The Big Picture

Here's how the Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP) works:

```
Customer has a task ‚Üí Finds your agent ‚Üí Pays upfront ‚Üí Your agent works ‚Üí Delivers result ‚Üí You get paid
```

**Key Points:**
- Customers pay **before** work starts (no payment collection hassles)
- You keep 100% of the payment (minus small network fees)
- No ETH or gas fees needed - Virtuals Protocol handles everything
- Your agent works automatically while you sleep

## üõ†Ô∏è What You Need to Get Started

### Required Items (Must Have)
1. **Computer** with internet connection
2. **GAME API Key** - Free from Virtuals Console
3. **Crypto Wallet** - Any wallet (MetaMask, etc.)
4. **Business Idea** - What service will your agent provide?
5. **30 minutes** of your time

### Optional Items (Nice to Have)
6. **OpenAI Account** - For AI-powered responses ($5-20/month)
7. **Web Server** - If you want custom processing (can start without this)

### Don't Worry About
- ‚ùå Coding experience
- ‚ùå Blockchain knowledge  
- ‚ùå Server management
- ‚ùå Payment processing
- ‚ùå Gas fees or ETH

## üìã Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Get Your GAME API Key (5 minutes)

1. Go to [Virtuals Console](https://console.virtuals.io)
2. Click "Sign Up" or "Login"
3. Create your account
4. Navigate to "API Keys" section
5. Click "Create New API Key"
6. Copy the key - it looks like: `game_12345abcdef...`

**üí° Tip:** Save this key in a notepad - you'll need it later.

### Step 2: Set Up Your Wallet (5 minutes)

You need two wallets for this system:

**Wallet A (Whitelisted Wallet):**
- This sends transactions (but Virtuals pays the fees)
- You'll register this wallet with Virtuals
- Extract the private key (don't share this with anyone!)

**Wallet B (Payment Wallet):**
- This receives your earnings
- Just need the address (starts with 0x...)

**How to get your private key:**
1. In MetaMask: Settings ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Reveal Private Key
2. Copy the private key (starts with 0x...)
3. Save it securely (never share this!)

### Step 3: Register Your Agent (10 minutes)

1. Go back to [Virtuals Console](https://console.virtuals.io)
2. Look for "Agent Registration" or "Service Registry"
3. Fill out the form:
   - **Agent Name:** "My Data Analysis Service"
   - **Description:** "Analyzes customer data and creates reports"
   - **Wallet Address:** Your Wallet A address
   - **Service Price:** Start with $0.01 for testing
4. Submit and wait for approval
5. Note down your **Entity ID** (usually a number like "1" or "123")

**üí° Important:** Write down your Entity ID - you'll need this!

### Step 4: Download and Setup the Code (5 minutes)

Even though you're not a developer, you need to run some code. Don't worry - we've made it super simple:

1. **Install Node.js:**
   - Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
   - Download the "LTS" version
   - Install it (keep clicking "Next")

2. **Install PNPM:**
   - Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
   - Type: `npm install -g pnpm`
   - Press Enter and wait

3. **Download the Agent Code:**
   ```bash
   # Copy and paste these commands one by one:
   git clone https://github.com/dylanburkey/acp_boilerplate.git
   cd acp_boilerplate
   pnpm run setup
   ```

### Step 5: Configure Your Agent (5 minutes)

A file called `.env` was created. Open it with any text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, etc.) and fill in your details:

```env
# Your API key from Step 1
GAME_API_KEY=game_12345abcdef...

# Your wallet private key from Step 2
WHITELISTED_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=0x1234567890abcdef...

# Your Entity ID from Step 3
WHITELISTED_WALLET_ENTITY_ID=1

# Your payment wallet address from Step 2
AGENT_WALLET_ADDRESS=0xYourPaymentWallet...

# Your business details
SERVICE_NAME="My Data Analysis Service"
SERVICE_DESCRIPTION="Analyzes CSV data files and creates summary reports with charts for small businesses. Processes files up to 5MB with sales, customer, or inventory data."
API_ENDPOINT=https://your-api-endpoint.com
```

**üí° Important Notes:**
- Replace ALL the placeholder values with your real information
- Keep the quotes around text values
- The description should be VERY specific about what you do

## üß™ Test Your Agent

Before going live, test everything:

```bash
# Check if everything is configured correctly
pnpm run validate

# Test with fake customers (no real money involved)
pnpm run dev:mock
```

You should see messages like:
```
‚úÖ Setup validation complete!
üì• New job received: mock-123456
‚öôÔ∏è Processing job mock-123456  
‚úÖ Job mock-123456 completed successfully
```

## üöÄ Launch Your Agent

When testing looks good:

```bash
# Start your live agent
pnpm run dev
```

Your agent is now live and earning money!
