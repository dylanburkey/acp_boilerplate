## üõ†Ô∏è Category 1: Agent Won't Start

### Problem: "Missing Environment Variables"
**What you see:**
```
‚ùå Missing or placeholder values for: GAME_API_KEY
```

**What it means:** You haven't filled in your configuration properly.

**Easy Fix:**
1. Open the `.env` file in your `acp_boilerplate` folder
2. Look for lines that still say things like `your_api_key_here`
3. Replace ALL placeholder text with your real information:
   - `GAME_API_KEY` = Your actual API key from Virtuals Console
   - `WHITELISTED_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` = Your real wallet private key
   - `AGENT_WALLET_ADDRESS` = Your real wallet address
4. Save the file
5. Try again: `pnpm run validate`

**Double-check:**
- API key starts with `game_`
- Private key starts with `0x`
- Wallet address starts with `0x`
- No quotes around the values unless they were already there

### Problem: "Node.js Version Error"
**What you see:**
```
Error: Node.js 18 or higher is required
```

**What it means:** Your computer has an old version of Node.js.

**Easy Fix:**
1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. Download the "LTS" version (green button)
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts
4. Close and reopen your terminal
5. Try again: `pnpm run dev`

**Double-check:**
- Download the **LTS** version, not "Current"
- Completely restart your terminal after installation
- If still not working, restart your computer

---

### Problem: "Command Not Found: pnpm"
**What you see:**
```
pnpm: command not found
```

**What it means:** PNPM isn't installed on your computer.

**Easy Fix:**
1. Open terminal or command prompt
2. Type: `npm install -g pnpm`
3. Press Enter and wait for installation
4. Try again: `pnpm run dev`

**If that doesn't work:**
1. Try: `npx pnpm install` instead
2. Or use npm directly: `npm install && npm run dev`

---

### Problem: "Build Failed"
**What you see:**
```
TypeScript compilation failed
```

**What it means:** There's a problem with the code files.

**Easy Fix:**
1. First try: `pnpm run validate`
2. If validation passes, try: `rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install`
3. Then: `pnpm run build`

**If still broken:**
1. Delete the entire `acp_boilerplate` folder
2. Start over with: `git clone https://github.com/dylanburkey/acp_boilerplate.git`
3. Follow the setup steps again

## üõ†Ô∏è Category 2: Agent Starts But No Jobs

### Problem: "No Active Jobs Found"
**What you see:**
```
Found 0 active jobs
Checking for new jobs...
```

**What it means:** Either no one needs your service, or they can't find you.

**Easy Fix - Check Registration:**
1. Go to [Virtuals Console](https://console.virtuals.io)
2. Log in and check your agent status
3. Make sure it shows "Active" or "Approved"
4. Verify your service description is clear and specific

**Easy Fix - Lower Your Price:**
1. Open `.env` file
2. Find `SERVICE_PRICE=0.001`
3. Change to `SERVICE_PRICE=0.01` (1 cent)
4. Save and restart your agent

**Easy Fix - Improve Description:**
Make your service description MORE specific:

**Bad:** "AI assistant for general tasks"
**Good:** "Analyzes customer sales spreadsheets and creates summary reports with charts for small retail businesses"

**Bad:** "Data analysis service"  
**Good:** "Customer data analysis that identifies top buyers, seasonal trends, and growth opportunities for e-commerce stores"

---

### Problem: "Agent Not Visible to Customers"
**What you see:** Agent runs fine but customer never find you.

**What it means:** Your registration might not be complete.

**Easy Fix:**
1. Go to [Virtuals Console](https://console.virtuals.io)
2. Check if your agent shows in the public directory
3. If not visible, contact Virtuals support
4. Make sure your wallet is properly whitelisted

**Common Registration Issues:**
- Wrong wallet address in registration
- Entity ID doesn't match your configuration
- Service category too vague or wrong
- Pricing set too high for new agents

---

### Problem: "Wrong Target Audience"
**What you see:** Jobs come in but they're not what you expected.

**What it means:** Your service description attracts wrong customers.

**Easy Fix:**
1. Review recent job requests to understand what people want
2. Update your service description to be more specific
3. Add limitations to filter out unwanted requests

**Example Improvements:**
- Add "for businesses under 100 employees"
- Specify "CSV files only, up to 5MB"
- Include "English language only"
- Add "no medical or legal advice"

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Category 3: Jobs Keep Failing

### Problem: "High Failure Rate"
**What you see:**
```
‚ùå Job job_123 failed: Service error
‚ùå Job job_456 failed: Processing error
```

**What it means:** Your service logic has problems.

**Easy Fix - Check Your API:**
1. If using API service, test your API endpoint manually
2. Try opening your `API_ENDPOINT` in a web browser
3. If it doesn't load, fix your API first
4. Make sure your API accepts POST requests with JSON data

**Easy Fix - Use Different Service Type:**
1. Open `src/index.ts`
2. Find line: `this.agentService = new DefaultAgentService();`
3. Replace with: `this.agentService = new CustomAgentService();`
4. This uses simpler built-in logic instead of your API

**Easy Fix - Extend Timeout:**
1. Open `.env` file
2. Add: `TX_CONFIRMATION_TIMEOUT=120000` (2 minutes)
3. Save and restart your agent

---

### Problem: "Validation Errors"
**What you see:**
```
‚ùå Job failed: Invalid input data
‚ùå Request outside service scope
```

**What it means:** Customers are sending data your agent can't handle.

**Easy Fix:**
1. Make your service description MORE specific about what you accept
2. Add examples of correct input format
3. List what file types/sizes you support

**Example Service Description Update:**
```
BEFORE: "Data analysis service"

AFTER: "Sales data analysis for retail businesses. 

Accepts: CSV files with columns for Date, Product, Quantity, Price
File Size: Maximum 5MB
Output: PDF report with sales trends and recommendations
Processing Time: 2-5 minutes"
```

---

### Problem: "Timeout Errors"
**What you see:**
```
‚ùå Job failed: Processing timeout
‚ùå Request took too long to process
```

**What it means:** Your service is too slow.

**Easy Fix:**
1. Reduce complexity of your processing
2. Use faster external APIs
3. Process smaller chunks of data
4. Increase timeout in configuration

**Quick Timeout Fix:**
1. Open `.env` file
2. Change: `ACP_PROCESSING_DELAY=3000` to `ACP_PROCESSING_DELAY=1000`
3. Add: `JOB_EXPIRATION_HOURS=2` (extend job lifetime)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Category 4: Payment Problems

### Problem: "No Payments Received"
**What you see:** Jobs complete but wallet balance doesn't increase.

**What it means:** Payments going to wrong wallet or delayed.

**Easy Fix - Check Wallet Address:**
1. Open `.env` file
2. Find `AGENT_WALLET_ADDRESS=0x...`
3. Copy that address
4. Open your wallet (MetaMask) and verify it matches
5. If different, update `.env` with correct address

**Easy Fix - Check Different Wallet:**
1. Sometimes payments go to the whitelisted wallet instead
2. Check the balance of your `WHITELISTED_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` wallet
3. If money is there, you can transfer it to your main wallet

**Easy Fix - Wait for Confirmation:**
1. Blockchain payments can take 5-15 minutes
2. Check your wallet balance again after waiting
3. Look for pending transactions

---

### Problem: "Wrong Payment Amount"
**What you see:** Receiving different amount than expected.

**What it means:** Service price might be wrong or fees deducted.

**Easy Fix:**
1. Check your actual service price in Virtuals Console
2. Remember there might be small network fees (usually under $1)
3. Verify your `SERVICE_PRICE` in `.env` file matches what you set

---

### Problem: "Payments Delayed"
**What you see:** Jobs completed hours ago but no payment.

**What it means:** Blockchain congestion or escrow delay.

**Easy Fix:**
1. Wait 24 hours - sometimes blockchain is slow
2. Check blockchain explorer with your wallet address
3. Contact Virtuals support if over 24 hours

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Category 5: Performance Issues

### Problem: "Agent Too Slow"
**What you see:** Jobs taking 5+ minutes to process.

**What it means:** Your processing logic needs optimization.

**Easy Fix - Use Faster Service:**
1. Switch to AI service if doing text processing
2. Use simpler logic instead of complex calculations
3. Process data in smaller chunks

**Easy Fix - Optimize Configuration:**
1. Open `.env` file
2. Change: `ACP_PROCESSING_DELAY=3000` to `ACP_PROCESSING_DELAY=1000`
3. Add: `ACP_MAX_RETRIES=1` (reduce retry attempts)

**Easy Fix - Check Internet Speed:**
1. Test your internet speed at speedtest.net
2. Slow internet = slow API calls = slow processing
3. Consider upgrading internet or using cloud hosting

---

### Problem: "Memory Issues"
**What you see:**
```
Error: Out of memory
Process killed
```

**What it means:** Your agent is using too much computer memory.

**Easy Fix:**
1. Restart your agent: Press Ctrl+C, then `pnpm run dev`
2. Process smaller files (under 1MB if possible)
3. Add memory limits to your configuration

**Easy Fix - Clear Cache:**
1. Stop your agent (Ctrl+C)
2. Run: `rm -rf node_modules/.cache`
3. Run: `pnpm run build`
4. Start again: `pnpm run dev`
