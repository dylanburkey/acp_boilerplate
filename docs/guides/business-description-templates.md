## What Makes a Good Description

### ✅ Good Practices

- **Specific scope**: "JavaScript code analysis" vs "general programming help"
- **Clear inputs/outputs**: Buyers know exactly what to provide and expect
- **Defined limitations**: "supports files under 10MB" prevents scope creep
- **Realistic timing**: Helps buyers set expectations
- **Target audience**: Helps right buyers find your service

### ❌ Avoid These Mistakes

- **Too broad**: "AI assistant for anything you need"
- **Vague capabilities**: "helps with business tasks"
- **No limitations**: Invites requests outside your scope
- **Unrealistic promises**: "instant results for any request"
- **Technical jargon**: Use language your buyers understand
