# Quick Deploy ACP Integration - Implementation Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: 🟡 Core Functionality Complete - Testing Phase

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. ACP Seller Agent Core ✅
- [x] ACP client initialization and configuration
- [x] Job lifecycle handlers (REQUEST, NEGOTIATION, TRANSACTION, EVALUATION)
- [x] Sequential job queue processing (prevents transaction conflicts)
- [x] Proper deliverable formatting (IDeliverable interface compliance)
- [x] Error handling and retry logic
- [x] Statistics tracking

**File**: `src/services/quickDeploy/acpSellerAgent.ts`

### 2. Payment Monitoring System ✅ **CRITICAL**
- [x] Blockchain event monitoring for USDC transfers
- [x] Payment transaction hash capture
- [x] Configurable timeout and confirmation requirements
- [x] Payment verification methods
- [x] Integration with deployment flow

**File**: `src/services/quickDeploy/paymentMonitor.ts`

**Why Critical**: This solves the "tricky bit" of capturing payment TX hash from ACP's TRANSACTION phase, which is required by Kosher Capital's API.

### 3. Contract Deployment ✅
- [x] Ephemeral wallet generation for gas fees
- [x] Factory contract integration
- [x] Contract deployment with retry logic
- [x] Transaction monitoring
- [x] Contract address extraction

**File**: `src/services/quickDeploy/contractUtils.ts`

### 4. Kosher Capital API Integration ✅
- [x] Quick Deploy API client
- [x] Proper request formatting
- [x] Error handling
- [x] Health check endpoint
- [x] Retry logic

**File**: `src/services/quickDeploy/kosherCapitalClient.ts`

### 5. Supporting Infrastructure ✅
- [x] Transaction tracking system
- [x] Notification service
- [x] Status API endpoints
- [x] Configuration management
- [x] Type definitions
- [x] Error handling framework

## 🔄 Complete Job Flow

```
1. REQUEST Phase
   ├─ Buyer initiates job through ACP (e.g., Butler)
   ├─ Validate service requirements
   ├─ Create transaction record
   └─ Accept job → Move to NEGOTIATION

2. NEGOTIATION Phase
   ├─ Agree on standard terms (50 USDC, immediate delivery)
   └─ Proceed to TRANSACTION

3. TRANSACTION Phase ⭐ (Core Implementation)
   ├─ 🔍 Monitor blockchain for payment
   │   ├─ Watch for USDC Transfer event
   │   ├─ From: Buyer wallet
   │   ├─ To: Agent wallet
   │   ├─ Amount: 50 USDC
   │   └─ ✅ Capture payment TX hash
   ├─ 📝 Generate contract creation transaction
   │   ├─ Create ephemeral wallet for gas
   │   ├─ Call factory contract
   │   └─ ✅ Get contract creation TX hash
   ├─ 🚀 Call Kosher Capital Quick Deploy API
   │   ├─ agentName
   │   ├─ paymentTxnHash ✅ (from payment monitor)
   │   ├─ contractCreationTxnHash ✅ (from deployment)
   │   ├─ creating_user_wallet_address
   │   └─ deploySource: "ACP"
   ├─ 📦 Format deliverable
   │   └─ { type: 'text/json', value: JSON.stringify(result) }
   └─ 🎁 Deliver to buyer

4. EVALUATION Phase
   ├─ Buyer evaluates deliverable
   └─ Job marked as COMPLETED
```

## 🎯 What Makes This Functional

### Payment Transaction Hash Capture
**Before**: ❌ Undefined - blocking Kosher Capital API
**After**: ✅ Captured via blockchain monitoring

The PaymentMonitor:
- Polls blockchain for USDC Transfer events
- Filters for exact amount (50 USDC) to agent wallet
- Waits for required confirmations
- Returns complete payment transaction details

### Deliverable Format
**Before**: ❌ Type error - QuickDeployDeliverable ≠ IDeliverable
**After**: ✅ Properly wrapped in IDeliverable format

```typescript
const formattedDeliverable = {
  type: 'text/json' as const,
  value: JSON.stringify(deliverable),
};
```

### Job Lifecycle Handlers
- ✅ REQUEST: Validates and accepts quick-deploy jobs
- ✅ NEGOTIATION: Confirms standard terms
- ✅ TRANSACTION: Executes full deployment flow
- ✅ EVALUATION: Auto-approves (buyer-side, placeholder)

## 📋 Environment Configuration

Required variables (all present in `.env.quickdeploy.example`):

```bash
# ACP Configuration ✅
GAME_API_KEY=                        # Virtuals Protocol API key
WHITELISTED_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=      # Wallet for transactions
WHITELISTED_WALLET_ENTITY_ID=        # Entity ID
AGENT_WALLET_ADDRESS=                # Payment recipient
SERVICE_NAME="Launch a trading agent"
SERVICE_DESCRIPTION="Quick deployment of an AI trading agent"

# Kosher Capital API ✅
API_ENDPOINT=                        # Quick Deploy endpoint
API_KEY=                             # Private API key

# Contract Addresses ✅
FACTORY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=            # Original factory (not new)
USDC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=               # Base USDC
PAYMENT_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS=           # Payment destination

# Service Settings ✅
SERVICE_PRICE=50                     # USDC
DEPLOYMENT_SOURCE=ACP                # For analytics
```

## 🚧 Known Limitations

### 1. Test Coverage
- Unit tests need to be written
- Integration tests with mock ACP needed
- End-to-end testing with Butler pending

### 2. TypeScript Errors (Non-Critical)
- ~33 errors remaining (mostly in test files and edge cases)
- Core functionality not affected
- Test files missing `@jest/globals` package
- Some unused variables in utility functions

### 3. Gas Wallet Management
- Ephemeral wallets created but funding mechanism not automated
- Need to implement gas wallet top-up system
- Manual funding required for testing

### 4. Error Recovery
- Payment monitoring has timeout (5 min default)
- Need to handle timeout gracefully and notify buyer
- Partial deployment recovery not fully implemented
