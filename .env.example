# ACP BEST PRACTICES NOTES
# ========================================
#
# 1. Start with sandbox environment and low service price ($0.01)
# 2. Complete 10 successful sandbox transactions for graduation
# 3. Keep service description clear and specific to prevent scope creep
# 4. Set appropriate job expiration time based on your service complexity
# 5. Monitor SLA compliance - expired jobs trigger automatic refunds
# 6. Only process requests that match your service capabilities
